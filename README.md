# UnlessIf
The most useless Perl-Module ever. Replaces if's with unless and unless's with if on random. Also, it replaces 

> } elsif (a()) {

with 

> } elsif (!a()) {

with a chance of 50%.

# RNG

The RNG used is from the module Math::Random::Secure, so it *really* is random the best way a computer can do it.

# Usage
If you ever find this script useful for *anything*, please tell me for what. I cannot figure out any use even with all of my imagination.
